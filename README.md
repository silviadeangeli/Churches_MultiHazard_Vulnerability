Index-based Multi-hazard Vulnerability Assessment Methodology for Churches

|| Background ||

The Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction recognizes the importance of cultural heritage for society and emphasize the need to assess their vulnerability from multiple hazards. Developing adequate multi-hazard vulnerability assessment processes is fundamental to this end. Still, given the large number of cultural heritage assets that can be exposed to different hazards in a region, the development of simplified multi-hazard approaches that can provide an initial risk screening of multiple assets to identify the need for more detailed analyses plays a central role for prioritization.
In this context, we propose an index-based multi-hazard vulnerability assessment methodology for churches, able to consider vulnerability from earthquakes, floods, and fire. The proposed multi-hazard index is obtained by combining a series of indicators, defined by performing a literature review.  
The vulnerability indicators constitute the primary component of a five-step, multi-hazard vulnerability assessment methodology that can be flexi-bly applied as a prioritization method to rapidly screen multiple assets and identify the most vulnerable churches that may require a more detailed assessment.
